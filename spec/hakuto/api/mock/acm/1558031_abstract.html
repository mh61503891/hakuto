             <div style="display:inline"><p>In planning as well as in other areas, temporal logic has been used to specify so-called <i>temporally extended goals</i>. Temporally extended goals refer to desirable <i>sequences of states</i> instead of a set of desirable <i>final states</i> as the traditional notion of achievement goal does, and provide for more variety in the types of goals allowed. In this paper, we show how temporally extended goals can be integrated into the agent programming language Goal. The result is that Goal agents may now have both beliefs about the future as well as have temporally extended goals. We propose a new decision making mechanism that takes temporally extended goals into account, and investigate properties of this framework.</p></div>
